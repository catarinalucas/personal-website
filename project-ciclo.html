        <p>— Since the theme was the question “Who are we?” we
          decided to answer with something that connects the designers
          with every other citizen from our hometown: we are humans. Simple uh?
          As humans, everyone is affected by the design in our day-to-day
          so the goal of our project is to pass the idea that the
          design is for everyone, freeing it from the label that is
          something futile and unnecessary.
          To translate graphically our concept, we opted to make
          projections, since an image, projected in different surfaces, adquires different
          shapes and expressions, although in the end it’s still the same. </p>
