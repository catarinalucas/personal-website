        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>Before we got too excited with this project and because the market for learning platforms can be a little saturated we analysed the competition and searched for painpoints and ways to improve our own concept.</p>

        <p>We tested the apps for a week and learned that in general the acitivties were very goal-based and that was not what we were aiming for.</p>

        <div class="col-12 col-9-sm">
          <p>We needed to learn more about what the parents needs and how we could build a product for children. So we decided to do user interviews with both parents and chilcare experts.</p>

      <div>
        <h5>User Interviews</h5>

              <li>In your opinion, is there any stage in the life of child that's it's more favorable to interaction with other children? </li>

        <h5>Design Sprint</h5>
        <p>To make a better use of the data we gathered, and to create a little more of collaboration between the team, we decided to do a design sprint.</p>
        <p>We built user journeys, how might we's, and left the sprint with a rough prototype and a bunch of constraints to keep in mind.</p>
