          <p>They're often nor accessible or affordable to everyone, so more and more parents are leaving their kids with a trusted caregiver, whom might not have the knowledge or ability to create a thriving and safe environment for the kid's growth.</p>

        <p class="col-12 u-mt-2 project-text">Before we got too excited with this project and because the market for learning platforms can be a little saturated we analysed the competition and searched for painpoints and ways to improve our own concept.</p>

        <p>Used a modular scale system for the typeface and a 8px grid.</p>
        <p>Everything was built from scratch by our team, from the logo to illustrations. </p>
