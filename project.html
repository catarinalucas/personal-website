        <p>â€” We have developed a magazine in the image
          of our brain which contains two hemispheres,
          left and right, one connected to science and
          logical reasoning and another connected to art
          respectively. As you navigate in the magazine
          to the right the articles are consequently becoming
          more artistic and with space dedicated to the image.</p>
